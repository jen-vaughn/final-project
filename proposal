# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

X-Mas Tic-Tac-Toe


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A two-player tic-tac-toe game that is Christmas themed.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be able to have two players play against each other in tic-tac-toe. Each player will be able to choose which space to move to, and it will keep track and decide who wins. I will execute this through IDLE.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A basic tic-tac-toe game that works, and the project has few errors in the rules of tic-tac-toe.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A unique tic-tac-toe game with a Christmas theme with Christmas game pieces, and the project has little to no errors in the rules of tic-tac-toe.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A unique tic-tac-toe game with the Christmas decorations and Christmas pieces, and the project has no errors at all in the game and piece rules of chess. The game also has a fun Christmas background and plays Christmas music.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I will think about and plan exactly what I want my end product to be. I will begin programming by first setting up the tic=tacc-toe board layout and
letting each player select a each piece. Then, I will figure out how to code for knowing what spots are taken and how to save the board progress and display the new board
each round. I will need to research how to code for setting a background image behind the game, as well as how to play background music.
